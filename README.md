# Context
Gauntlet (1985 - Atari) is a fantasy-themed hack-and-slash arcade developed and producted by Atari Games. Our job in this project was to recreate (with artistic liberty) this game using the Assembly RISC-V language. The main objective was to implement the following:
- Graphics interface (Bitmap Display, 320×240, 8 bits/pixel);
- Keyboard interface (Keyboard and Display MMIO simulator);
- At least 3 levels with different layouts;
- Animation and movement of player and their attacks;
- Colision with walls and enemies
- System for opening doors with keys collected
- Condition for winning levels or failing them (losing due to lack of life points)
- At least two types of enemies that move and attack the player;
- Menu with score, level and player's health;
- Audio interface, music and sound effects.
